> From Orchestrator release version 1.7, Workflow Types will be retired. All workflows will act as infrastructure workflows, and no workflow will act as an assesment workflow. <br>
> This workflow is a continuation of an assessment workflow. Therfore, that workflow will be obsolete and won't server as a perliminary to this one. See [examples](#how-to-run).

# Azure list subscriptions workflow
The workflow logs in to Azure and lists the subscriptions. It uses token propagation. Therefore, it is meant to be used via RHDH UI and not via API.

## Prerequisite
* Access to Azure account via token and API.

## Workflow application configuration
Application properties can be initialized from environment variables before running the application:

| Environment variable  | Description | Mandatory | Default value |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| `AZURE_URL`      | The URL to the Azure API server. Usually https://management.azure.com | âœ… | |
