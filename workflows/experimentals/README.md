- **Not actively maintained**
- **Not tested for production use**
- **Not officially supported**

> ⚠️ **Use at your own risk.**

## Purpose

These examples are provided to:

- Showcase possible workflow structures and capabilities
- Serve as inspiration for developing your own workflows
- Act as starting points for prototyping or experimentation

## Disclaimer

These workflows may be incomplete, outdated, or incompatible with newer versions of the system. They are shared *as-is* and may break or behave unpredictably.
